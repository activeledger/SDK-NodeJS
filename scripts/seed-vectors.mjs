//   fromSeed(type, seed)   takes the ALGORITHM'S OWN seed. No derivation, no
//                          KDF, no phrase. 32 bytes for ml-dsa-65 and
//                          secp256k1, 48 for falcon-512. This is the portable
//                          private-key format: the same seed gives the same
//                          identity in every SDK.
//
//   fromPhrase(type, ...)  takes a BIP-39 recovery phrase, derives a seed for
//                          the requested type, and hands it to fromSeed.
//
// Layer one is what makes PHP interoperable at all. paragonie/pqcrypto_compat
// implements FIPS 204 keygen from a seed but not skEncode/skDecode, so an
// ml-dsa-65 private key there IS a 32-byte seed and the 4032-byte encoding
// every other SDK exports cannot be loaded. Once every SDK can import a seed,
// that stops being a dead end.
