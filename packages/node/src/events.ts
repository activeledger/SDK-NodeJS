 *
 * @deprecated ActiveCore is deprecated and should not be used, and events
 * are no longer served by it. A node now serves contract events from its
 * own storage service, which must never be reachable beyond the node's
 * host - so a client SDK has nothing it should connect to. Run your own
 * server-sent events listener on the node's host
 * (`http://localhost:<storage port>/activeledgerevents/events`) and relay
 * what your application needs. This class will be removed in a future
 * major version.
